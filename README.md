### Built with 
1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. HTML

I built this website with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Javascript for the functions and DOM manipulations, HTML for the basic structure of the application and CSS for the button styling and over all styling of the page. The sounds are just some that I found off the internet that were free and in a short wav file for simplicity. 

This was built in part from the Wes Bos videos with some changes to sounds and images.
